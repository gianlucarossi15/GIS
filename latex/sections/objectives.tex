\section{Objective of the Studies}
The goal of this project is the development of a Geographic Information System for road maintenance of the Italian Padova Province.
The objectives to achieve are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item managing the vertical sign, by providing the possibility of knowing the positions of the signs and their attributes, like type of sign and date of installation and the possibility to add new signs.
    \item detecting the state of the road network. The system has to store informations about the conditions of the road, i.e. presence of malformations; also it is necessary to collect the maintenance interventions  performed. 
    \item complying with the obligation to set up the roads registry according to DM n. 3484 of 01-06-2001 and to comply with national and international standards. In particular to follow the DM n.3484, each road is identified by a code and related attributes that describe its peculiar characteristics such as the road surface or the type of surface it is made of. Furthermore, the system must guarantee the management of temporary road closures, for example for maintenance work, ensuring dynamic management of such events. In this way, a division will be maintained between the information relating to these temporary problems and the information on the roads which is kept constant.
