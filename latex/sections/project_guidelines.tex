\section{Project Guidelines}

\subsection{Cost analysis}
In this section, they will be outlined the cost of developing GIS system previosly described.
Into the making of a project, there two types of cost: the cost of the project itself, plus costs that are needed to maintain and renew the system.

\subsubsection{Project cost}
In the table below, there three types of costs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{technician cost}: this \$30  unit cost is associated to one hour of work from an external technician to setup one of the three servers.
    \item \textbf{WebApp developer cost}: \$70 is the amount of money that the developer of the Web Application will receive for one hour of work.
    \item \textbf{Java developer cost}: \$46 is the amount of money that the developer of the openJUMP plugins will receive for one hour of work. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Running costs}
In the running costs table, there two types of costs: the one regarding the Server maintenance that it is carried out once year and its fixed, and the cost associated to the assistance, which it depends on how many hours a year a technician on-site o remotely, will be necessary for troubleshooting.

    \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
        \toprule
        Activity & Unit cost & Quantity & TOTAL \\
        \midrule
        Server maintenance & 1500 & 1 & \$1500,00 \\
        Remote assistance & 20 & X & \$20*X \\
        On-site assistance & 30 & X & \$30*X \\
        \midrule
        TOTAL & & & \$1500,00 + variable cost \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
